  /**
   odd number

   Given 7 natural numbers,
   select all odd natural numbers among them and find their sum,
   and select the odd numbers
   Write a program to find the minimum of

   For example, given the seven natural numbers
   12, 77, 38, 41, 53, 92, and 85, the odd ones are 77, 41, 53,
   85, so the sum is
   77 + 41 + 53 + 85 = 256
   becomes,
   41 < 53 < 77 < 85
   Therefore, the smallest of the odd numbers is 41.

   ▣ Input description
   The first line contains 7 natural numbers.
   The given natural number is less than 100. more than one odd number
   must exist

   ▣ Output Description
   The sum of the odd numbers is printed on the first line,
   and the minimum of the odd numbers is printed on the second line.

   ▣ Input Example 1
   12 77 38 41 53 92 85
   ▣ Output example 1
   256
   41
